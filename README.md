## rackspace_cloudserver.py

This was a good execise to understand the HTTP/REST base cloud API Rackspace has. It helped to understand and see in practice how the fist generation Racspace Cloud API works on a HTTP/REST level. This script shows how you can construct the GET/POST/DELETE requests according the the API specification to achive expected results.
