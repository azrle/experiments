## rackspace_cloudserver.py

This was a good execise to understand the HTTP/REST base cloud API Rackspace has. It helped to understand and see in practice how the fist generation Racspace Cloud API works on a HTTP/REST level. This script shows how you can construct the GET/POST/DELETE requests according the the API specification to achive expected results.

Usualy it is not necessry to write code on such a low level. There is a python library that exposes pythonic object related interface to work with the API.
